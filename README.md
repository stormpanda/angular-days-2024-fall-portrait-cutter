# Portrait cutter

This project was created during Angular Days 2024 in Berlin during an AI workshop. It takes a set on images of people that you put into the "input" folder and tries to find faces in them. It will find the first face in an image, then crops to that face and removes the background.

Every piece of code was written by ChatGPT 4o. I just copied all code from left to right, asking ChatGPT 4o for help for all problems that occurred and prompting it to extend functionality. Not a single line of code was written manually.

Functionality is far from perfect, but it was a funny experiment to build such complex functionality with 0 knowledge of that field and without any noteworthy python knowledge.

## Run the script

Just put files into the "input" folder and run `python crop_centered_face.py`. The results can be found in the "output" folder.
